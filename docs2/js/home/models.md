# Models

The type system for wildspace is the most critical component,
defining the different states game resources can be in,
how they can be located, and ultimatley how the entire
system should be structured.

The `@astral-atlas/wildspace-models` library contains 
definitions for all these types, as well as pure functions
that operate on those types exclusivley, and cast functions.

The models library also contains another key element: the
API schema type defenitions.
