# Model Resource Editor Section

The Model Resource Editor is a component that lets a DM
change a Model Resource.

Actually that's a lie - Model Resources are mostly immutable.
However, you can define a set of "Model Parts" that refer
to a specific "object" inside the 3D scene.

Thie editor lets you view all the existing models parts that
might be defined for this resource, and add or remove them.
