# Preview Sidebar Layout

This layout encapsulates a common design pattern for having an editor:
typically a 3d scene is displayed in the preview area,
and the right pane is reserved for manipulating the scene.

The Top Pane is typically used for selection, and the Bottom Pane
for editing the currently selected element(s).

For this implementation, the divisions between preview and control panes,
and the divisions of the top and bottom panes are resizable (to a minimum extent.)
