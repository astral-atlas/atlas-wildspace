# Resource Chip

A resource chip is a layout container that contains
a Game Resource and displays it in a uniform manner.

There is also a family of components designed
to be rendered inside a resource chip and match
the styles.

Generally, resource chips can be seen in vertical
lists to describe sub-resources.

```ts
import {
  ResourceChip,
  ResourceChipInlineRow,
  ResourceChipDivider, 
  ResourceChipLabel,
  ResourceChipActionRow
} from "@astral-atlas/wildspace-components";

```
