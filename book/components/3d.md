# 3D Components

Wildspaces makes use of act-three and the three.js library to render 3d interactive content.

## Tech

We use a canvas as a render target, and use webGL commands to program render calls to it.

We model the scene using act-three and GLTF assets, piping the scene graph to three.js to render for us.
