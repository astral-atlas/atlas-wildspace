# Audio Assets

Audio plays a large role in Wildspace - uploading custom musical cues and tracks
is managed by the AudioAssetLibrary.

## Concepts

### AudioTrack
An AudioTrack represents a set-length piece of audio content with
a name (and optionally a cover image).

### AudioPlaylist
A playlist is a array of tracks in a specific order.
### AudioPlaylistState
A playlist state describes how far through a playlist you are.
